Hello,
If you are an employer you may want to read this.
I may add a project or changed (added fittures or modified, or fixed bugs) the existing files, and didn't want to resend a new CV.

I added a new folder will hold a password genarator. Already finished the genarator script. I am going to add a GUI and the ability to save the password with a username and the name of the application it will be use for as a JSON file.

Thank you for your time, and have a plessent day
