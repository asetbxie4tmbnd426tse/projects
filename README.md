(14/6/2021) Made a functional saving butten. The function can add the new acount details to en existing JSON file.

I added a new folder will hold a password genarator. Already finished the genarator script. I am going to add a GUI and the ability to save the password with a username and the name of the application it will be use for as a JSON file.

updates: Added delete option to delete tasks from a project in project management website. password generator GUI is still in work. The generating GUI itself is working. Saving option is still in development.
